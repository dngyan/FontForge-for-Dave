ttf2eps [-all] {-name ps-name | -unicode hex | -uni hex | -glyph num} ttf-font

Reads the specified true-type file and extracts the indicated glyphs into
eps file. Each file is named for the character extracted (according to the
'post' table). Multiple glyphs may be extracted at a time, either by specifying
the character's name, it's unicode encoding, or it's true type glyph number.
All the glyphs may be extracted by using -all.

Files are created in the current directory.

Some meta-information is provided in comments inside each .eps file, for
example the character's width, the font's ascent, descent and number of
units per em.
