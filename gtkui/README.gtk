This is an incomplete fontforge which uses the gtk toolkit.

About all it can do is open a font and display it. If a menu command does not
require a dialog then it might work. There are probably scores of bugs even in
the little bit that supposedly does work.

The open dialog is extremely ugly. That's not my fault, that's gtk's widget.
The open dialog is far less functional than the one in the gdraw fontforge --
I can't figure out how to enhance it.
