These files are used for building pfaedit cidmap files given adobe's
cid2code.txt files. Adobe's files may be found at
	ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/pub/examples/nutshell/cjkv/adobe/
Each cidmap file has a different generation file (it should be obvious what
goes with what). cidmaps should be generated by:
	$ gcc -o map mapjapan1.c
	$ map <aj14/cid2code.txt >Adobe-Japan1-4.cidmap
(or whatever file you are trying to generate)
